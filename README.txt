This is just a little project I was working on to develop a
machine learning model to predict diabetes rates based on diet.

The dataset isn't really large enough to model this way but it was fun to practice.

For the webpage to launch properly, first run the cleaning_and_machining notebook, then run the 
app.py file. Go to the IP address listed. The predictive nature of the model is clearly not working,
likely due to the afformentioned dataset size issues.

All the data is sourced from diabetesatlas.org, healthdata.org, and https://ourworldindata.org/diet-compositions.
